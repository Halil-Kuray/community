# About us

Proxeus has now transitioned into a community-run project (see _[Every Ending is a new Beginning](https://www.proxeus.com/blog-posts/every-ending-is-a-new-beginning)_), run by a group of people passionate about open source and this software project in particular. We have made it our mission to maintain and develop the Proxeus framework and to foster its adoption within our possibilities and an openly governed community (see _[Introducing Proxeus Open Source Association](https://www.proxeus.com/blog-posts/introducing-proxeus-open-source-association)_).

The Proxeus Association is running various activities, such community outreach, hackathon participation, presentations, that are having to do with the code components. Please note that we cannot answer questions related to the token generation event of the Proxeus token (XES): token holders should direct such questions to Proxeus Anstalt.

We are also setting up a new DAO to involve software users as well as the wider community in the governance of the association's activities. It may be possible to use tokens to vote for the development of specific new features in the future. For now we are coordinating the development work using open access platforms like GitHub.

We are happy to answer your questions to the best of our knowledge in the forum, or by email to `association@proxeus.org`
