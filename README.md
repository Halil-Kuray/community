Proxeus Association
===

Proxeus has now transitioned into a community-run project (see _[Every Ending is a new Beginning](https://www.proxeus.com/blog-posts/every-ending-is-a-new-beginning)_).

We are a group of people passionate about open source and this software project, who have made it our mission to maintain and develop the Proxeus framework and to foster its adoption within our possibilities (see _[Introducing Proxeus Open Source Association](https://www.proxeus.com/blog-posts/introducing-proxeus-open-source-association)_).

In this repository we would like to develop connections with the community around this project. You can already use the [Issues page](https://github.com/ProxeusApp/community/issues) (at least, until we have a more advanced forum) to ask questions, raise concerns, share ideas for the future. In the [Wiki](https://github.com/ProxeusApp/community/wiki), we will keep a knowledge base updated with frequently asked questions.

## Status as of September 2020

Our association was founded in the summer and we are still in the process of organizing start up activities (e.g. community outreach, hackathon participation, presentations).

Please note that we cannot answer questions related to the token generation event or the Proxeus token. Token buyers should direct such questions to Proxeus Anstalt.

We are actively investigating the setup of a DAO to involve the token holders in the governance of the association's activities. For example, tokens could be used to vote for the development of specific new features. The association would then be in a good position to coordinate the ensuing development work using open source platforms such as GitHub.

We are happy to answer your questions about the Proxeus framework itself to the best of our knowledge by email to `association@proxeus.org` or on the [Issues page](https://github.com/ProxeusApp/community/issues).
